For this project, I perform an exploratory anlysis on singles that went number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from the 1950s to present. I focused my analysis on answering the following questions:

* Which decade had the most number one singles?

* Which artists have the most number one singles?

* Are songs that go number one sung more by women or men? Solo acts or ensembles/groups?

* Of all songs that went number one since 1950, are there any commonalities between the songs? Like tempo, valence, etc. ?

* Is there any trends among audio features? (i.e. Does tempo stay consisent among the decades, or does it exhibit some type of cyclical pattern?)

* Are genres consistent among number ones? Do all songs have similar genres?

* Are songs in each decade distinct? Specifically, are songs in each decade statistically different than the others?

The notebook I used for exploratory analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/d-alvear/Analyzing-Music-by-Decade/blob/main/notebooks/7-exploration-and-analysis.ipynb)/[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/Analyzing-Music-by-Decade/blob/main/notebooks/7-exploration-and-analysis.ipynb), which contains all code, visualizations, and explanations. I also performed PCA and K Means clustering on the dataset; the notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/d-alvear/Analyzing-Music-by-Decade/blob/main/notebooks/8-pca-clustering.ipynb) and the mini-writeup can be found [here]().

The final writeup of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/d-alvear/Analyzing-Music-by-Decade/blob/main/reports/project-writeup.md).
