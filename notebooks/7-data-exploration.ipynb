    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From the _List of Billboard number-one singles_ Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_number-one_singles): \n",
    ">The following year-by-year, week-by-week listings are based on statistics accrued by Billboard magazine before and after the inception of its Hot 100 popularity chart in August 1958.\n",
    "All data is pooled from record purchases and radio/jukebox play within the United States. Later charts also include digital single sales, online streaming, and YouTube hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "Explore the data, answer preliminary questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Of all songs that went number one since 1950, are there any commonalities between the songs? Like tempo, valence, etc. ?\n",
    "2. Is there any cyclical patterns? For example, popular songs today sound very disco-like from the 70s and very synth-like from the 80s. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are genres consistent among number ones? Do all songs have similar genres?\n",
    "4. Are songs that go number one sung more by women or men? Solo acts or ensembles/groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are just a starting point to guide this analysis. I'll describe further questions as I go."
