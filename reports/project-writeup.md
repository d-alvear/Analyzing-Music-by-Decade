For this project, I perform an exploratory anlysis on singles that went number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from the 1950s to present. I focused my analysis on answering the following questions:

* Which decade had the most number one singles?

* Which artists have the most number one singles?

* Are songs that go number one sung more by women or men? Solo acts or ensembles/groups?

* Of all songs that went number one since 1950, are there any commonalities between the songs? Like tempo, valence, etc. ?

* Is there any trends among audio features? (i.e. Does tempo stay consisent among the decades, or does it exhibit some type of cyclical pattern?)

* Are genres consistent among number ones? Do all songs have similar genres?

* Are songs in each decade distinct? Specifically, are songs in each decade statistically different than the others?
